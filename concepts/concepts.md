Why do this?
=======
 
Ideas for long term project.

1. Parallel hardware/ software: ultimate synchronization/disynchronization machine 
2. Evolutionary hardware: circuit that grows on it's own. 
3. Rapid prototyping for computational hardware projects 

Short term goal

1. Become familiarize with software (verilog/VHDL) and hardware from Altera and Xilinx. 
2. Build example projects provided by the tool
